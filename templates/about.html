            Welcome onboard, brave cosmonaut! My name is Roberto and I am a 24 years old earthling from Presezzo, Italy.
            This is my pretty blog where I post random articles about my life and interests. Hope you have a pleasant stay!

            Oh, and by the way! Feel free to come by and post articles yourself. :D
